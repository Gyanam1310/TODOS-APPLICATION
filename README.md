# 📝 Todo List App

A minimal and responsive Todo List web application that helps users create, manage, and save tasks efficiently in the browser using local storage.

## 📄 Description

This is a simple yet functional Todo List app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. All data is stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions without needing a backend.
